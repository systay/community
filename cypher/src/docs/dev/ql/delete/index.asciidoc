Delete
======
Removing graph elements -- nodes, relationships and properties, is done with +DELETE+. It takes a list of expressions,
separated by commas. The expressions must either be return either a node, a relationship, a path, or a collection of these;
or it can be a property expression, which leads to that property being deleted.
